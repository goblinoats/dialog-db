//! Authority capability hierarchy — identity chain.
//!
//! The authority chain encodes the identity hierarchy as a capability chain:
//!
//! ```text
//! Subject (repository DID)
//! └── Profile { profile: Did, account: Option<Did> }
//!     └── Operator { operator: Did }
//! ```
//!
//! [`Identify`] is a direct env command that returns the current
//! `Capability<Operator>` chain. It is not a capability itself — session
//! identity is ambient state, so we query it from the env rather than
//! pretending it scopes to a subject.
