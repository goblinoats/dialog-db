//! Layered deductive-rule resolution.
//!
//! A query reads from a stack of layers — each branch in scope, plus
//! the per-query [`Changes`] overlay. Just as facts are unioned across
//! layers (see [`layer`](crate::layer)), *rules* are too: each layer
//! reports the deductive rules it holds concluding a queried concept,
//! and the union of those — plus the implicit per-descriptor rule built
//! once — is what the query engine plans.
//!
//! # Storage shape (`db.rule/*`)
//!
//! A deductive rule is stored as facts:
//! - `db.rule/conclusion` `of` rule-entity `is` the concept entity it
//!   concludes — the index a layer looks rules up by.
//! - `db.rule/source` `of` rule-entity `is` the canonical dag-cbor
//!   `DeductiveRuleDescriptor` (a `Value::Bytes`) — the body, hydrated
//!   via `DeductiveRule::decode`. (Bytes, not Record: `Value::Record`
//!   isn't yet supported end-to-end through the index; the bytes are
//!   opaque to the query layer either way.)
//!
//! These names are a dialog-repository convention (like
//! `dialog.session/*` / `dialog.meta/*`).
//!
//! # Two layers, two caches
//!
//! - A **durable** layer reads a branch's committed tree. Its rule
//!   discovery (the `conclusion` lookup) is cacheable by branch head —
//!   the committed rule set for a concept only changes when the head
//!   moves. Hydrated bodies are cached by content-addressed rule entity.
//! - A **transient** layer reads the per-query overlay. Overlay rules
//!   (`tx.assert(rule)` / `.with(rule)`, uncommitted — the head has NOT
//!   moved) are read fresh every query and never head-cached. Keeping
//!   the overlay in its own layer is what makes the "overlay rule masked
//!   by a head-keyed cache" bug structurally impossible.
