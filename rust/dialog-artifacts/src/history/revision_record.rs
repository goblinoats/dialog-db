/// Everything a revision states about itself, as one atomic record.
///
/// Stored as a single fact in the ordinary EAV/AEV/VAE indexes — entity =
/// [`Version::entity`], attribute = [`REVISION_ATTRIBUTE`], value =
/// [`Value::Record`] of this struct's dag-cbor encoding. One record per
/// revision keeps the metadata atomic (a revision is never partially
/// described: the record is present or it is not), makes each step of
/// ancestor traversal a single exact lookup, and is the unit the issuer
/// signs. Individual fields are exposed to queries through formulas over
/// the record rather than stored as separate facts.
///
/// The attribute lives in the reserved `dialog.` namespace: user
/// instructions cannot write it (see
/// [`ReservedAttribute`](DialogArtifactsError::ReservedAttribute)), so at
/// the library level lineage cannot be corrupted through the ordinary
/// write path. Against a hostile peer crafting records on the wire, the
/// record carries the issuer's signature over every other field, and it
/// binds itself to its slot: the [`Version`] it was recorded under is
/// derivable from the record's own contents ([`RevisionRecord::version`]),
/// so a valid record replayed at a different revision entity is detected
/// just like a tampered one (see [`RevisionRecord::verify`]).
///
/// The revision's tree root is deliberately absent: the record lives
/// inside that tree, so the root cannot appear inside itself. The head
/// `Revision` published to the branch cell carries the root — and its own
/// signature binding the root to the issuer.
