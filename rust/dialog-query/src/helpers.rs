//! Benchmark helpers for the query engine.
//!
//! [`BenchEnv`] builds a real query environment (operator + repository +
//! branch) and runs queries through the actual branch-select path. It is
//! designed for benchmarks that need three signals:
//!
//! 1. **Read count** — the number of block fetches a query triggers,
//!    recorded via [`JournaledStorage`]. This is the planner's true
//!    objective (minimize round-trips) and is deterministic and
//!    machine-independent.
//! 2. **In-memory wall-clock** — engine CPU isolation, via a volatile
//!    [`BenchEnv::volatile`] environment.
//! 3. **On-disk wall-clock** — real-world latency where I/O dominates,
//!    via an [`BenchEnv::temp`] environment backed by the platform temp
//!    directory.

// The runtime imports below use `::dialog_query::…`, but the
// `#[derive(Concept)]`/`#[derive(Attribute)]` expansions emit bare
// `dialog_query::…` paths, so the name must also resolve without the
// leading `::`. No declaration is needed here in either build context: in
// the crate's own (test) build the lib root already aliases itself with
// `extern crate self as dialog_query`, and in the bench build this file is
// `#[path]`-included into a separate target where Cargo links the package's
// own lib under the `dialog_query` name (its extern prelude), so bare
// `dialog_query::…` resolves to the real crate in both.
